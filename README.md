# Optimizing Exploration with a New Uncertainty Framework for Active SLAM Systems
This repository is under construction.


## Project Description
This repository contains the code and associated resources for our research on optimizing exploration in active SLAM systems through a new uncertainty framework. The data of all simulations are in  [data](data)

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seba-san/UncertaintyMap.git 
```

## Installation
Follow the instructions in [instructions](instructions.md) to build and run the Docker container, and to launch simulations.

## Configuration
You can adjust the simulation parameters by modifying the **parameters.yaml** and/or **simulaciones_planificadas.yaml** files as needed.

## Aditional Resources
